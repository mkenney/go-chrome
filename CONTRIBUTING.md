By contributing code and feedback to this project, you agree to abide by the terms of the [MPLv2 LICENSE](LICENSE).

# Code of conduct

Don't be an ass. If you get called out for being an ass, please just stop being an ass and let it go. If I'm being an ass, call me out and I'll also try to knock it off. Nobody is perfect. I'll be a very sad panda if I ever have to add to this section.

To that end, you hereby agree to abide by the [contributor covenant](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Contributing

## Report bugs

Please be as detailed as you can when [opening an issue](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/issues/new/choose) to report a bug. An issue template is provided when a new issue is created to help with what I need to troubleshoot a problem. If you have a suggestion for how to resolve the issue please include that as well (or better yet, open a [pull request](#pull-requests)).

## Suggest enhancements

To suggest an enhancement please start a discussion by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/issues/new/choose) and, as best you can, clearly describe any changes you would like to see and what benefit they give you or the API as a whole. All suggestions of any kind are welcome!
