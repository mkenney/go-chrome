This package aims to be a complete [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) implementation. The primary use-case behind this project is interacting with [headless Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) in a container environment, but it should be appropriate for developing server side and desktop applications for any browser that supports the devtools protocol.

The API is fairly settled and basic code-coverage tests have been implemented but real-world testing is needed. [`Page.captureScreenshot`](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#method-captureScreenshot) and related calls are working well and are regularly used for validating the viability of code changes.

This implementation is based on the [Tip-of-Tree](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/) documentation and may be prone to change. At some point stable versions will be implemented as well, hopefully beginning with v1.3.

# Examples

There are a few small examples of how to use the framework API on the [wiki](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/wiki) and in the [`/_examples`](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/tree/master/_examples) directory.

# TODO

Contributions of any kind are very welcome!

* Resolve [race condition issues](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/pull/119). Any assistance is appreciated!
* Add framework API examples to the `/_examples` directory and wiki to showcase various ways people are using the package.

  Any example scripts showing various ways people are using the framework would be outstanding! The [screenshot script](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/blob/master/test/screenshot/main.go) and several others are available there.

* Refactoring to implement standard interfaces where applicable and review current use of interfaces in the API. Some aren't needed at all and others are used to support test mocks.
* Add more tests, particularly for error cases.
* Add integrated tests to stablize package interactions raised in various issues.

If you would like to contribute but aren't sure how, take a look at [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mkenney/go-chrome) for any tests that could be written. There are [many](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/blob/master/tot/socket/cdtp.animation_test.go) [examples](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/blob/master/tot/cdtp/animation/enum.animation.type_test.go) of tests in the repo.
