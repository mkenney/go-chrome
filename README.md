        This package aims to be a complete <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/">Chrome DevTools Protocol</a> implementation. My primary use-case is interacting with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome">headless Google Chrome</a> in a container environment, but this should be appropriate for developing server side and desktop applications as well.
        <br><br>
        This is a work in progress. I think most things are workable now but I still need to add tests and happy-path test more of the APIs. I have <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#method-captureScreenshot">`Page.captureScreenshot`</a> working fairly well and have been using that for validating changes so far. This implementation is based on the <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/">Tip-of-Tree</a> documentation and may be prone to change. At some point I will implement stable versions as well.
        <br><br>
        The API should be stable but is not yet production ready.

# Examples

I added a few small examples to the [wiki](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/wiki).

# TODO

Add more tests. So many tests... If you would like to contribute but aren't sure how, there are several [open issues](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Amkenney%2Fgo-chrome%2F1) for tests that need to be written, I'll try to keep that list up to date. There are also [several examples](https://github.com/mkenney/go-chrome/blob/master/socket/cdtp.animation_test.go) of tests that have already be written.

Any contributions to tests or otherwise are very welcome!
